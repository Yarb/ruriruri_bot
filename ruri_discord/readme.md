This is the lightweight and limited version of the bot for Discord. 

Basically this bot just posts the status of the space when changes happen and uses reports from the Telegram bot. As such this is intended to be used in conjunction with the telegram side of things.
In our use case, the Telegram and Discord are bridged. However due to limitations of Telegram bots, message passing between them is forbidden. Thus this bot was created for the Discord.

Given that Discord bots can see one another, these two bots might be merged in the future to simplify the system.

**TODO**
The resources used by this are basically identical so they should be rolled up into one to save space.
